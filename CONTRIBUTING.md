## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
- Git
- Visual Studio Code (optional but recommended)
- Basic knowledge of Docker and Dockerfile syntax

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Clone your fork:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vscode_dev_docker.git
   cd vscode_dev_docker
   ```

2. **Add upstream remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/vscode_dev_docker.git
   ```

3. **Create a development branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make your changes** and test locally

5. **Keep your fork synced:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/master
   ```

### Testing Changes

**Build and test the Docker image:**

```bash
# Build with custom tag
docker build -t spark-dev:dev .

# Test basic functionality
docker run -it spark-dev:dev bash -c "
  spark-submit --version &&
  java -version &&
  scala -version &&
  python3 --version
"

# Test with VS Code (if using devcontainer)
code .
# Then use: Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container
```

**Validate the Dockerfile:**

```bash
# Use hadolint for Dockerfile linting
docker run --rm -i hadolint/hadolint < Dockerfile

# Security scan
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  aquasec/trivy image spark-dev:dev
```

## Style Guidelines

### Dockerfile Guidelines

- **Use official base images**: Prefer official images (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`)
- **Pin versions**: Always specify exact versions for reproducibility
- **Minimize layers**: Combine RUN commands where logical
- **Clean up**: Remove temporary files and caches in the same layer
- **Security first**: Run as non-root user when possible
- **Label everything**: Use LABELs for metadata
- **Order matters**: Put frequently changing commands last for better caching

**Example:**

```dockerfile
# Good
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        package1 \
        package2 \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Bad
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y package1
RUN apt-get install -y package2
RUN apt-get clean
```

### Documentation Guidelines

- **Use clear language**: Write for all skill levels
- **Include examples**: Show don't just tell
- **Keep it updated**: Update docs with code changes
- **Use proper markdown**: Follow markdown best practices
- **Link related sections**: Help users navigate

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

**Format:**

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
