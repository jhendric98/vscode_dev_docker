# Security Policy

## Overview

Security is a top priority for this project. We take all security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure from the security community.

## Supported Versions

The following versions of this project are currently being supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Yes            | Active development |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå No             | Deprecated |

**Note:** We recommend always using the latest version from the `master` branch for the most up-to-date security patches.

## Security Features

This Docker container implements several security best practices:

### ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures

- **Non-root User Execution**: Container runs as `sparkuser` (UID 1000) to minimize privilege escalation risks
- **Minimal Base Image**: Uses official Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with only essential packages
- **Regular Updates**: Base image and dependencies are regularly updated
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No credentials or sensitive data in the image
- **Read-only Root Filesystem Compatible**: Can be run with `--read-only` flag (with appropriate volume mounts)
- **Layer Optimization**: Minimal layers to reduce attack surface
- **Package Verification**: Uses official package repositories with GPG verification

### üîç Security Best Practices for Users

When using this container, we recommend:

1. **Keep Images Updated**

   ```bash
   docker pull spark-dev:latest
   docker image prune -a  # Remove old images
   ```

2. **Run with Limited Privileges**

   ```bash
   docker run --security-opt=no-new-privileges:true spark-dev:latest
   ```

3. **Use Docker Secrets for Sensitive Data**

   ```bash
   # Don't pass secrets via environment variables
   # Use Docker secrets or mount encrypted volumes instead
   ```

4. **Scan Images Regularly**

   ```bash
   # Use tools like Trivy or Snyk
   trivy image spark-dev:latest
   ```

5. **Network Isolation**

   ```bash
   # Use custom networks instead of host networking
   docker network create spark-network
   docker run --network spark-network spark-dev:latest
   ```

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### üö® Where to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@example.com` (Replace with your actual security contact)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/yourusername/vscode_dev_docker/security/advisories) feature
3. **Private Disclosure**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub

### üìã What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: PoC code if applicable
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have recommendations for remediation
- **Environment Details**:
  - Docker version
  - Host OS
  - Container configuration used

### üìÖ Response Timeline

You can expect the following response times:

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| **Initial Response** | Within 48 hours |
| **Vulnerability Assessment** | Within 7 days |
| **Status Update** | Weekly until resolved |
| **Fix Development** | Depends on severity (see below) |
| **Disclosure** | After patch release (coordinated) |

### üî¥ Severity-based Response

| Severity | Response Time | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | 24-48 hours | Remote code execution, privilege escalation |
| **High** | 7 days | Authentication bypass, significant data exposure |
| **Medium** | 30 days | Limited scope vulnerabilities |
| **Low** | 90 days | Minor issues with minimal impact |

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Our Commitment

- We will respond to your report within 48 hours with our assessment
- We will keep you informed of our progress towards resolving the issue
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We will not take legal action against researchers who:
  - Report vulnerabilities in good faith
  - Avoid privacy violations and data destruction
  - Follow responsible disclosure practices

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure model:

1. You report the vulnerability privately
2. We confirm and assess the issue
3. We develop and test a fix
4. We release the patch
5. We publish a security advisory (crediting you if desired)
6. You may publish your findings after the advisory

**Typical embargo period**: 90 days from initial report

## Known Security Considerations

### Container-Specific Concerns

1. **Spark Web UIs**: Spark UIs (ports 4040, 8080) have no authentication by default. In production:
   - Use a reverse proxy with authentication
   - Enable Spark's built-in security features
   - Restrict network access

2. **JVM Security**: Keep Java updated to patch known vulnerabilities:

   ```dockerfile
   # Rebuild regularly to get latest OpenJDK patches
   docker build --no-cache -t spark-dev:latest .
   ```

3. **Python Dependencies**: Regularly update Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip3 install --upgrade pip
   pip3 list --outdated
   ```

### Not Suitable For

‚ùå This container is **NOT production-ready** out of the box for:

- Multi-tenant environments without additional isolation
- Processing sensitive data without encryption
- Internet-exposed deployments without hardening

‚úÖ This container **IS suitable** for:

- Local development environments
- CI/CD testing pipelines
- Educational purposes
- Internal development teams

## Security Update Process

### For Maintainers

1. Security patches are prioritized above feature development
2. Critical vulnerabilities trigger immediate patch releases
3. Security advisories are published for all confirmed vulnerabilities
4. Automated dependency scanning runs on every commit

### For Users

- Watch this repository to receive security notifications
- Subscribe to GitHub Security Advisories
- Check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for security-related updates
- Rebuild your images regularly to incorporate upstream security patches
